Unlike GET requests that are typically benign and associated with standard web browsing, PUT requests can alter server state and are often utilized in web attacks to exploit vulnerabilities. As such, the presence of a PUT request strongly suggests malicious intent, leading to a 100% probability that the instance is classified as Anomalous. This is because legitimate web traffic rarely involves PUT requests, making them a clear indicator of potential security threats.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-42-ab7d05b066c4>:24: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide\n","  possibility_left = np.sum(Y[split_index[0]], axis=0)/np.sum(Y[split_index[0]])\n","<ipython-input-42-ab7d05b066c4>:25: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide\n","  possibility_right = np.sum(Y[split_index[-1]], axis=0)/np.sum(Y[split_index[-1]])\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","###################### SELECTION ######################\n","Question: The HTTP dataset CSIC 2010 contains thousands of web requests automatically generated.
